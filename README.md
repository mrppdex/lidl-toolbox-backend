## Lidl-Toolbox Backend

This is a backend of the Lidl-Toolbox project.

It is written in Node.JS and uses the Express.js library to serve REST api requests. It stores the data and the log in the MongoDB database.

At the moment, two main api ends are:

- *api/user* for manipulating *users* collection,
- *api/product* for manipulating *product* collection
